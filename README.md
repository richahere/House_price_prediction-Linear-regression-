# House_price_prediction-Linear-regression-
Linear Regression Model For Predicting Sale Price Of House.
In this implementation, we will be looking at the following the steps as follows:

1.    Importing Libraries and Dataset
2.    Scaling the dataset
3.    Checking Multicollinearity and removing it
4.    Creating test and training partitions
5.    Implementing the Linear Regression model
6.    Generating predictions over the test set
7.    Evaluating the model
8.    Preparing the Residual plot.
9.    Checking the Assumptions of Linear Regression.
10.   Visualising the Coefficient plot
